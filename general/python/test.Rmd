## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(rmarkdown)
```
```{r}

```
```{r}
head(penguins)
```
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#plotting the relationship between body mass and flipper length in the three penguin species


ggplot(data = penguins) +geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g))


#from the plot it is visible that as the body mass increases the flipper length also increases
```
```{r}
#plotting the relationship between body mass and flipper length by identifying similar species


ggplot(data = penguins) +geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g,color=species))


#from the plot it is more edvident that Gentoo Species have higher body mass

```
```{r}
#plotting the relationship between body mass and flipper length by identifying similar species and segregating the genders


ggplot(data = penguins) +geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g,color=species))+facet_grid(sex~species)
```
```{r}
#from the plot we can clearly distinguish male and female pengunis of diiferent species finding out number of penguins in each island


ggplot(data = penguins) +geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = island,fill=island))

```
```{r}
#finding out the count of penguins in each year based on gender


ggplot(data = penguins) +geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = year,fill=sex))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
